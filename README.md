# Bachelor-Intrinsic-F-T-sensor-system-3D-printed-parts

This folder contains the designed 3D objects used to conduct experiments on the K3D40-force sensor and the TRT-serie torque sensor. 

---- ForceShaft.step ----
- A 3D-printable shaft that connects to the TRT-sensor.

---- LinkageType4.step ----
- An early iteration of the linkage that connects the different sensor togehter. 
- Combines the K3D40 sensor and the TRT-sensor. 
- One continous part. 
- 3D-printable.

---- LinkageType7_3Dprint.step ----
- A late iteration of the linkage part.
- To components that locks together. 
- Combines the K3D40 sensor and the TRT-sensor. 
- Adjusted for 3D-printing with ASA, so that the two components slides together comfortably.

---- LinkageType7_Bigger_3Dprint.step ----
- A larger iteration of the one above. 
- Material added as an attempt to counteract material fatigue. 

---- LinkageType7_metal.step ----
- Not size adjusted. 
- Intended to be further adjusted for CNC production. 
- M3 threaded holes for the locking mechanism. 

---- TorqueShaft.step ----
- Similar to the force-shaft, but with an offset mounting in the XY-plane, so that torque can be applied around the mounting axis.
